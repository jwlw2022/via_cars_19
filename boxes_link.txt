things we need to change:
1. change numpy array to csv
2. switch from version 1 coco to the one we used in the tutorial
3. have the function only output the bounding boxes
4. maybe other things we find

1.
  xml_name = image_path.replace('.jpg', '.xml')
  xml_name = xml_name.replace("197/", '')
  np.savetxt(xml_name, output_dict['detection_boxes'], delimiter=",")
